### âœ… What does `-e .` mean in `requirements.txt`?

* `-e .` means **"install this project in editable mode"**.
* `.` means **"this folder"** (where your Python code is).

---

### ðŸ’¡ Why use it?

When you are **writing your own Python project**, and you want to:

* Test it while still making changes
* Avoid reinstalling again and again after each change

You use `-e .`.

---

### ðŸ§ª Example:

Imagine your folder looks like this:

```
my_project/
â”œâ”€â”€ setup.py
â”œâ”€â”€ my_code/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ hello.py
â””â”€â”€ requirements.txt
```

Your `requirements.txt` contains:

```
-e .
```

When you run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

It tells Python:

> "Install this folder (`my_project/`) as a package, but keep watching for any changes I make."

So if you edit `hello.py`, the changes will work **immediately** â€” no need to reinstall.

---

### ðŸ“Œ You should use `-e .` only if:

* You're building your own Python package or app
* Your folder has a `setup.py` file
